# React Testing
## Important!
Use `screen` which is a new export out of React Testing Library

Use `userEvent` rather than `fireEvent`

Latest versions of RTL are using `waitFor` instead of `wait`

Use MSW to mock out HTTP requests

## DOM Testing Library [Link] (https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro)

`screen` DOM Testing Library exports a screen object that can be used for querying and debugging, using `screen.debug`

`getByText` 


<!-- Arrange, act, assert -->
<!-- Notes jest components describe, test -->
## Resources 
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components.
